## JavaScript Execution

- **Reading Material**: https://precodes.hashnode.dev/demystifying-javascript-execution
- **Execution Context**: Environment where JavaScript code is run.
- **Call Stack**: Management structure that keeps track of the order of execution contexts.

### Execution Context Phases

1. **Memory Creation Phase**: JavaScript allocates memory to all the variables and functions.
2. **Code Execution Phase**: The code is run line by line and execution contexts are pushed into the call stack.
